=== How to read the function documentation
All functions are read like this : `Return Type` `Function's name`(`Argument Type` `Argument Name`) +
 +
This means that the function expects you to pass an argument of the argument type and it will return something of the return type or nil if something failed. Functions can have more that one argument. Argument names are just to indicate their use and you do not need to pass a variable with that exact name +
